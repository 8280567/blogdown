# Get Started

In this chapter, we show how to create a simple website from scratch. The website will contain a home page, an "About" page, one R Markdown post, and a plain Markdown post. You will learn the basic concepts for creating websites with **blogdown**. For beginners, we recommend that you get started with the RStudio IDE, but it is not really required. The RStudio IDE can make a few things easier, but you are free to use any editors if you do not care about the extra benefits in RStudio.

## Installation

We assume you have already installed R (https://www.r-project.org) and the RStudio IDE (https://www.rstudio.com). Next we need to install the **blogdown** package in R. Currently it is only available on Github (still a beta version), and you can install it using the **devtools** package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools")) install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('rstudio/blogdown')
```

Since **blogdown** is based on the static site generator Hugo (https://gohugo.io), you also need to install Hugo. There is a helper function in **blogdown** to download and install it automatically on major operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux):

```{r eval=FALSE}
blogdown::install_hugo()
```

By default, it installs the latest version of Hugo, but you can choose a specific version if you want.

For macOS users, `install_hugo()` uses the package manager Homebrew (https://brew.sh), which is the recommended way to install Hugo, but if you do not prefer installing or using Homebrew, you can call `blogdown::install_hugo(use_brew = FALSE)`.^[If you are not a software developer, the benefits of Homebrew may not be so obvious.] If you have never installed Homebrew before, the installation may take one or two minutes. If the installation fails for any reason,^[One possible reason for the failure might be that you do not have Xcode Command Line Tools, and you can try the command `xcode-select --install` in the Terminal.] `install_hugo()` will automatically retry with `use_brew = FALSE`.

## A quick example

From our experience, Hugo's documentation may be a little daunting to read and digest for beginners.^[One day Yihui was almost ready to kill himself when he was trying to figure out how `_index.md` works by reading the documentation over and over again, and desperately searching in the Hugo forum.] For example, its "Quickstart" guide has 12 steps, and you can easily get lost if you have not used a static website generator before. For **blogdown**, we hope users of all levels can at least get started as quickly as possible. There are many things you may want to tweak for the website later, but the first step is actually fairly simple: create a new project under a new directory in the RStudio IDE (`File -> New Project`), and call the function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
blogdown::new_site()
```

Then wait for this function to create a new site, download the default theme, add some sample posts, open them, build the site, and launch it in the RStudio Viewer, so you can immediately preview it. If you do not use the RStudio IDE, you need to make sure you are currently under an empty directory,^[Check the output of `list.files('.')` in R, and make sure it does not include files other than `LICENSE`, the RStudio project file (`*.Rproj`), `README` or `README.md`.] and `new_site()` will do the same thing but the website will be launched in your web browser instead of the RStudio Viewer.

Now you should see a bunch of directories and files under the RStudio project or your current working directory. Before we explain these new directories and files, let's introduce an important and helpful technology first: _LiveReload._ This means your website will be automatically rebuilt and reloaded in your web browser^[You can also think the RStudio Viewer as a web browser.] whenever you modify any source file of your website and save it. Basically once you launch the website in a web browser, you will not need to build it explicitly. All you need to do is to edit the source files, such as R Markdown documents, and there is no need to click any buttons or run any commands. LiveReload is implemented via `blogdown::serve_site()` based on the R package **servr**.^[Hugo has its own LiveReload implementation, but we did not take advantage of it in **blogdown** because Hugo does not know how to compile R Markdown documents.]

The `new_site()` function has several arguments, and you may check out its R help page (`?blogdown::new_site`) for details. A minimal default theme named "hugo-lithium-theme" is provided as the default theme of the new site,^[You can find its source on Github: https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme. This theme was forked from https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme and modified to work better with **blogdown**.] and you can see what it looks like in Figure \@ref(fig:lithium).

```{r lithium, fig.cap='The homepage of the default new site.', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/lithium-theme.png')
```

You have to know three most basic concepts for a Hugo-based website:

1. The configuration file `config.toml`, in which you can specify some global settings for your site. Even if you do not know what TOML is at this point (it will be introduced in Chapter \@ref(hugo)), you may still be able to change some obvious settings. For example, you may see configurations like these in `config.toml`:

    ```js
    baseurl = "/"
    relativeurls = true
    languageCode = "en-us"
    title = "A Hugo website"
    theme = "hugo-lithium-theme"

    [[menu.main]]
        name = "About"
        url = "/about/"
    [[menu.main]]
        name = "GitHub"
        url = "https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown"
    [[menu.main]]
        name = "Twitter"
        url = "https://twitter.com/rstudio"
    ```

    You can change the website title, e.g., `title = "My own cool website"`, and update the Github and Twitter URLs.

1. The content directory (by default, `content/`). This is where you write the R Markdown or Markdown source files for your posts and pages. Under `content/` of the default site, you can see `about.md` and a `post/` directory containing a few posts. The organization of the content directory is up to you. You can have arbitrary files and directories there, depending on the website structure you want.

1. The publishing directory (by default, `public/`). Your website will be generated to this directory. Typically it contains a lot of `*.html` files and dependencies like `*.css`, `*.js`, and images. You can upload everything under `public/` to any web server that can serve static websites, and your website will be up and running. There are many options for publishing static websites, and we will talk more about them in Chapter \@ref(deployment) if you are not familiar with deploying websites.

If you are satisfied with this default theme, you are basically ready to start writing and publishing your new website! 

## RStudio addins

There are a few essential RStudio addins to make it easy to edit and preview your website, and you can find them from the menu "Addins" on the RStudio toolbar:

- "Live Preview Site": it calls `blogdown::serve_site()` to continuously serve your website locally so you can live previewing it. This function will block your R console by default, meaning you will not be able to use your R console once you start this local web server. If you do not want this behavior, set the option `options(servr.daemon = TRUE)` before you click this addin or call the function `serve_site()`, so that the server is daemonized and will not block your R console. However, please note that the daemonized server is experimental (especially for Windows users).^[If you run into problems with the daemonized server, one workaround is to call `blogdown::serve_site()` in a seperate R session, and you can preview your website in your web browser but can still edit the website in RStudio.]

- "New Post": it provides a dialog box for you to enter the metadata of your blog post, including the title, author, date, and so on. See Figure \@ref(fig:new-post) for an example. This addin actually calls the function `blogdown::new_post()` under the hood, but does a few things automatically:

    - As you type the title of the post, it will generate a filename for you, and you can edit it if you do not like the automatically generated one. In fact, you can also use this addin to create normal pages under any directories under `/content/`. For example, if you want to add a resume page, you can change the filename to `resume.md` from the default `post/YYYY-mm-dd-resume.md`.

    - You can select the date from a calendar widget provided in Shiny.

    - It will scan the categories and tags of existing posts, so when you want to input categories or tags, you can select them from the dropdown menus, or create new ones.
    
    - After a new post is created, it will be automatically opened, so you can start writing the content immediately.

- "Update Metadata": it allows you to update the YAML metadata of the currently opened post. See Figure \@ref(fig:update-meta) for an example. The main advantage of this addin is that you can select categories and tags from dropdown menus instead of having to remember them.

```{r new-post, fig.cap='Create a new post using the RStudio addin.', fig.align='center', out.width='80%', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/new-post.png')
```

```{r update-meta, fig.cap='Update the metadata of an existing post using the RStudio addin.', fig.align='center', out.width='70%', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/update-meta.png')
```

With these addins, you should rarely need to run any R commands manually after you have set up your website, since all your posts will be automatically compiled whenever you create a new post or modify an existing post due to the LiveReload feature.

## Global options

Depending on your personal preferences, you can set a few global options before you work on your website. These options should be set using `options(name = value)`, and currently available options are presented in Table \@ref(tab:global-options).

```{r global-options, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(matrix(c(
  'servr.daemon', 'FALSE', 'whether to use a daemonized server',
  'blogdown.author', '', 'the default author of new posts',
  'blogdown.use.rmd', 'FALSE', 'default new post format to R Markdown?',
  'blogdown.subdir', '', 'a subdirectory under /content/post/',
  'blogdown.method', 'html', 'the building method for R Markdown'
), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE, dimnames = list(NULL, c('Option name', 'Default', 'Meaning'))), booktabs = TRUE, caption = 'Global options that affect the behavior of blogdown.')
```

We recommend that you set these options in your R startup profile file. You can check out the help page `?Rprofile` for more details, and here is a simplified introduction. A startup profile file is basically an R script that is executed when your R session is started. This is a perfect place to set global options, so you do not need to type these options again every time you start a new R session. You can use a global profile file `~/.Rprofile`,^[The tilde `~` denotes your home directory in your system.] or a per-project file `.Rprofile` under the root directory of your RStudio project. The former will be applied to all R sessions that you start, unless you have provided the latter to override it. The easiest way to create such a file is to use `file.edit()` in RStudio, e.g.,

```{r eval=FALSE}
file.edit('~/.Rprofile')
# or file.edit('.Rprofile')
```

Suppose you always prefer the daemonized server, and want the author of new posts to be "John Doe" by default, you can set these options in the profile file:

```{r eval=FALSE}
options(servr.daemon = TRUE, blogdown.author = 'John Doe')
```

A nice consequence of setting these options is that when you use the RStudio addin "New Post", the fields "Author", "Subdirectory", and "Format" will be automatically populated, so you do not need to manipulate them every time unless you want to change the defaults (occasionally).

The option `blogdown.method` is explained in Section \@ref(methods).

## R Markdown vs Markdown {#output-format}

When you create a new post, you have to decide whether you want to use R Markdown or plain Markdown, as you can see from Figure \@ref(fig:new-post). The main differences are:

1. You cannot execute any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```` ```{r} ````). However, you can still embed R code in plain Markdown using the syntax for fenced code blocks ```` ```r ```` (note there are no curly braces `{}`). Such code blocks will not be executed, and may be suitable for pure demonstration purposes. Below is an example of an R code chunk in R Markdown:


    ````markdown
    `r ''````{r cool-plot, fig.width='80%', fig.cap='A cool plot.'}
    plot(cars, pch = 20)  # not really cool
    ```
    ````
    
    And here is an example of an R code block in plain Markdown:
    
    ````markdown
    ```r
    1 + 1  # not executed
    ```
    ````

2. A plain Markdown post is rendered to HTML through [Blackfriday](https://gohugo.io/overview/configuration/) (a package written in the Go language and adopted by Hugo), and an R Markdown document is compiled through the **rmarkdown** package and Pandoc.

There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday's Markdown and Pandoc's Markdown. For example, you can write a task list with Blackfriday but not with Pandoc:

```markdown
- [x] Write an R package.
- [ ] Write a book.
- [ ] ...
- [ ] Profit!
```

Similarly, Blackfriday does not support LaTeX math and Pandoc does. We have added the MathJax support to the default theme ([hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme)) in **blogdown** to render LaTeX math on HTML pages, but there is a caveat for plain Markdown posts: you have to include inline math expressions in a pair of escaped parentheses inside a pair of backticks `` `\(math\)` ``, e.g., `` `\(S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i\)` ``. Math expressions of the display style have to be written in `` `$$math$$` ``. For R Markdown posts, you can use `$math$` for inline math expressions, and `$$math$$` for display-style expressions.^[The reason that we need the backticks for plain Markdown documents is that we have to prevent the LaTeX code from being interpreted as Markdown. Backticks will make sure the inner content is not translated to HTML, e.g., `` `$$x *y* z$$` `` will be converted to `<code>$$x *y* z$$</code>`. Without the backticks, it will be converted to `$$x <em>y</em> z$$`, which is not a valid LaTeX math expressions for MathJax. Similar issues can arise when you have other special characters like underscores in your math expressions.]

If you find it is pain to have to remember the differences between R Markdown and Markdown, a conservative choice is to always use R Markdown, even if your document does not contain any R code chunks. Pandoc's Markdown is much richer than Blackfriday, and there are only a small number of features unavailable in Pandoc but present in Blackfriday. The main disadvantages of using R Markdown are:

1. You may sacrafice some speed in rendering the website, but this may not be noticeable due to a caching mechanism in **blogdown** (more on this in Section \@ref(methods)). Hugo is very fast when processing plain Markdown files, and typically it should take less than one second to render a few hundreds Markdown files.

1. You may have some intermediate HTML files in the source directory of your website, because **blogdown** has to call **rmarkdown** to pre-render `*.Rmd` files `*.html`. You will also have intermediate folders for figures (`*_files/`) and cache (`*_cache/`) if you have plot output in R code chunks or have enabled **knitr**'s caching. Unless you care a lot about the "cleanness" of the source repository of your website (especially when you use a version control tool like GIT), these intermediate files should not matter.

For any R Markdown documents (not specific to **blogdown**), you have to specify an output format. There are many possible output formats in the **rmarkdown** package (such as `html_document` and `pdf_document`) and other extension packages (such as `tufte::tufte_html` and `bookdown::gitbook`). Of course, the output format for websites should be HTML. We have provided an output format function `blogdown::html_page` in **blogdown**, and all R Markdown files are rendered using this format. It is based on the output format `bookdown::html_document2`, which means it has inheritted a lot of features from **bookdown** in additional to features in Pandoc. For example, you can number and cross-reference math equations, figures, tables, and theorems, etc. See Chapter 2 of the **bookdown** book [@xie2016] for more details on the syntax.

Note that the output format `bookdown::html_document2` in turn inherits from `rmarkdown::html_document`, so you need to see the help page `?rmarkdown::html_document` for all possible options for the format `blogdown::html_page`. If you want to change the default values of the options of this output format, you can add an `output` field to your YAML metadata. For example, we can add a table of contents to a page, set the figure width to be 6 inches, and use the `svg` device for plots by setting these options in YAML:

```yaml
---
title: "My Awesome Post"
author: "John Doe"
date: "2017-02-14"
output:
  blogdown::html_page:
    toc: true
    fig_width: 6
    dev: "svg"
---
```

At the moment, not all features of `rmarkdown::html_document` are supported in **blogdown**, such as `df_print`, `code_folding`, `code_download`, `theme`, `highlight`,^[Syntax highlighting can be added through the JavaScript highlight.js. See \@ref(how-to) for details.] and so on.

If your code chunk has graphics output, we recommend that you avoid special characters like spaces in the chunk label. Ideally, you should only use alphanumeric characters and dashes, e.g., ```` ```{r, my-label}```` instead of ```` ```{r, my label}````.

## Different building methods {#methods}

If your website does not contain any Rmd files, it is very straightforward to render it --- just a system call to the `hugo` command. When your website contains Rmd files, **blogdown** has provided three different rendering methods to compile these Rmd files. A website can be built using the function `blogdown::build_site()`:

```{r eval=FALSE, code=formatR::usage(blogdown::build_site, output=FALSE)}
```

As mentioned in Section \@ref(global-options), the default value of the `method` argument is determined by the global option `blogdown.method`, and you can set this option in `.Rprofile`.

Both `html` and `html_encoded` use `rmarkdown::render()` to render Rmd files to HTML, and the technical differences between them are:

1. `method = 'html'` renders `*.Rmd` to `*.html`, and keeps the `*.html` output file under the same directory as `*.Rmd`; `method = 'html_encoded'` will move `*.html` to the directory `/blogdown/`.

1. An Rmd file may generate two directories for figures (`*_files/`) and cache (`*_cache/`), respectively, if you have plot output or HTML widgets [@R-htmlwidgets] in your R code chunks, or enabled the chunk option `cache = TRUE` for caching. In the figure directory, there will be a subdirectory `figure-html/` that contains your plot output files, and possibly other subdirectories containing HTML dependencies from HTML widgets (e.g., `jquery/`). For `method = 'html'`, it moves the figure directory to `/static/`, and the cache directory to `/blogdown/`. For `method = 'html_encoded'`, all output files and directories are moved to `/blogdown/`, including figures, cache, and `*.html`.

1. The name of the method `'html_encoded'` comes from the fact that the paths of R plot files and HTML widgets are first encoded in the `*.html` output, then Hugo is called to build the website, and finally all HTML files under the `/public/` directory are post-processed to decode the paths. The main reason for this trouble is that it is not easy to predict where a certain page will be rendered in the `/public/` directory,^[For example, a source file `/content/about.md` may be rendered to `/public/about/index.html`, and `/content/post/2017-02-14-hello.Rmd` could be rendered to `/public/2017/02/14/hello/index.html` (the content of the post could also be used in `/public/categories/index.html`). It dependes on the rules for permanent links you set for Hugo.] so the relative paths of figures and widgets may fail to work after a site is rendered, and they need to be resolved by post-processing. By comparison, `method = 'html'` does not need post-processing due to the fact that the relative paths will be resolved to absolute paths at the pre-processing stage.

We must have successfully confused you now, but do not worry. You do not have to understand these technical details, unless you want to help us with hacking. For an average user, you only need to know the pros and cons of the two methods.

- For `method = 'html'`:

    - Your `/content/` directory may not be completely clean, since it also contains `*.html` files.
    
    - If you use HTML widgets in Rmd, the HTML pages may not conform to W3C standards,^[W3C stands for World Wide Web Consortium: https://www.w3.org. In case you are really curious: the problem with `method = 'html'` for HTML widgets is that CSS styles may be declared in the `<body>` tag.] but the widgets will be most likely to work well anyway.
    
    - If your website is supposed to be placed in a subdirectory under a domain name (e.g., `http://example.com/my-project/`) when it is published, you must use `relativeurls = true` in `config.toml`.
    
    - Besides these relatively minor disadvantages, the major advantage of `method = 'html'` is that your website is ready to be compiled by Hugo _alone_ after you have compiled it through **blogdown** once, because there is no need to use R or **blogdown** to post-process the website like `method = 'html_encoded'`. This advantage gives you the freedom to use deploying services like Netlify (Chapter \@ref(deployment)), where neither R nor **blogdown** is not available, but Hugo is. It is also much faster than `'html_encoded'.`

- For `method = 'html_encoded'`:

    - Your `/content/` directory is free of output files.
    
    - The HTML files under `/public/` should conform to standards.
    
    - There is no need to adjust the `relativeurls` option.
    
    - The disadvantages are: rendering the website is dependent on **blogdown** all the time, and it is relatively slow.^[It should not be too bad. Typically a website can be rendered in a few seconds.]

There is a caching mechanism in `build_site()` to speed up building your website: an Rmd file will not be recompiled when its `*.html` output file is newer (this test is done through comparing file modification times). If you want to force `build_site()` to recompile the Rmd file even if it is older than the HTML output, you need to delete the HTML output, or edit the Rmd file.

No matter which method you choose to use, `build_site()` will always look for an R script `/R/build.R` and execute it if it exists. This gives you the complete freedom to do anything you want for the website. For example, you can call `knitr::knit()` to compile Rmd to Markdown (`*.md`) in this R script instead of using `rmarkdown::render()`. This feature is designed for advanced users who are really familiar with the **knitr** package^[Honestly, it was originally designed for Yihui himself to build his own website, but he realized this feature could actually free users from Hugo. For example, it is possible to use Jekyll (another popular static site generator) with **blogdown**, too.] and Hugo or other static website generators (see Chapter \@ref(other-generators)).

For `method = 'custom'`, you are completely on your own and should be responsible for building the website using `/R/build.R`; `build_site()` will not call `rmarkdown::render()` or Hugo at all in this case.

The argument `local` of `build_site()` indicates whether you want to build the website for local preview or publishing. In the former mode (`local = TRUE`), a few Hugo options are temporarily changed when building the site:

- `baseurl` is set to `/`, which means the root URL is `/`, even if you have set it to another value like `http://example.com/` in `config.toml`. This is because we do not really want the URLs in our website to have the actual base URL when previewing the website locally (e.g., you may be offline and cannot connect to `http://example.com/`).

- Posts and pages with the options `draft: true` and/or `future: true` in the YAML metadata are always rendered, i.e., drafts and posts with future publication dates are rendered in the local preview mode.

In the latter mode (`local = FALSE`), no options are modified, and all your options set in `config.toml` and YAML metadata are respected.

The function `blogdown::serve_site()` calls `blogdown::build_site(local = TRUE)`. Even if the website generated by `serve_site()` under `/public/` is a functional website, we still recommend that you call `blogdown::build_site(local = FALSE)`^[You can omit `local = FALSE` since it is the default.] before you publish the `/public/` folder. If your drafts and future posts contain (time-)sensitive information, you are strongly recommended to delete the `/public/` directory before you rebuild the site for publishing every time, because Hugo never deletes it, and your sensitive information may be rendered by a certain `build_site(local = TRUE)` call last time and left in the directory. If the website is really important, and you need to make sure you absolutely will not screw up anything every time you publish it, put the `/public/` directory under version control, so you have a chance to see which files were changed before you publish the new site.

## Other themes

In the beginning, you will probably spend much time on looking for a Hugo theme that you like from the collection listed at http://themes.gohugo.io, if you care a lot about the appearance of your website. Please note that not all themes have been tested against **blogdown**. If you find a certain theme does not work well with **blogdown**, you may report to https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues, and we will try to investigate the reason.

After you have found a satisfactory theme, you need to figure out its Github user name and repository name, then either install the theme via `blogdown::install_theme()`, or just create a new site under another new directory and pass the Github repository name to the `theme` argument of `new_site()`. We recommend that you use the second approach, because Hugo themes could be very complicated and the usage of each theme can be very different and highly dependent on `config.toml`. If you use `new_site()` instead of `install_theme()`, the default sample `config.toml` of the theme will be copied to the root directory of your website, so you can edit it immediately, otherwise you will have to read the documentation of the theme carefully to know how to properly write a `config.toml` by yourself. To save you some time, we list a few themes below that match our taste:

- Simple/minimal themes: [simple-a](https://github.com/AlexFinn/simple-a), and [ghostwriter](https://github.com/jbub/ghostwriter).

- Sophisticated themes: [hugo-academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) (strongly recommended for users in academia), [hugo-future-imperfect](https://github.com/jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect), and [hugo-tranquilpeak-theme](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme).

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    # for example, create a new site with the academic theme
    blogdown::new_site(theme = 'gcushen/hugo-academic')
    ```

If you do not understand HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, and have no experience with Hugo themes or templates, it may take you about 10 minutes to get started with your new website, since you can basically accept everything you are given (such as the default theme). If you do have the knowledge and experience, it may take you several days to get started. Hugo is really powerful. Be cautious with power.
