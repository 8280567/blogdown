# Hugo

In this chapter, we will briefly introduce [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), the static site generator on which **blogdown** is based. This chapter is not meant to replace the official Hugo documentation, but provide a guide to those who are just getting started with Hugo. When in doubt, please consult the official Hugo documentation.

## Static sites and Hugo {#static-sites}

A static site often consists of HTML files (with optional external dependencies like images and JavaScript libraries), and the web server sends exactly the same content to the web browser no matter who visits the web pages. There is no dynamic computing on the server when a page is requested. By comparison, a dynamic site relies on a server-side language to do certain computing and sends potentially different content depending on different conditions. A common language is PHP, and a typical example of a dynamic site is a web forum. For example, each user has a profile page, but typically this does not mean the server has stored a different HTML profile page for every single user. Instead, the server will fetch the user data from a database, and render the profile page dynamically.

For a static site, each URL you visit often has a corresponding HTML file stored on the server, so there is no need to compute anything before serving the file to visitors. This means static sites tend to be faster in response time than dynamic sites, and it is also much easier to deploy, since the deployment simply means to copy static files to a server. A dynamic site often relies on databases, and you will have to install more software packages to server a dynamic site. For more advantages of static sites, please read the [introduction](https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/) on Hugo's website.

There are many existing static site generators, including Hugo, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and [Hexo](https://hexo.io), etc. Most of them can build general-purpose websites but are often used to build blogs.

We love Hugo for many reasons but there are a few that stand out. Unlike other static site generators, the installation of Hugo is very simple because it provides a single executable without dependencies for most operating systems (see Section \@ref(installation)). It was also designed to render hundreds of pages of content faster than comparable static site generators and can reportedly render a single page in approximately 1 millisecond. Lastly, the community of Hugo users is very active both on the [Hugo discussion forum](https://discuss.gohugo.io) and on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues).

Although we think Hugo is a fantastic static site generator, there is really one and only one major missing feature: the support for R Markdown. That is basically the whole point of the **blogdown** package.^[Another motivation was an easier way to create new pages or posts. Static site generators often provide commands to create new posts, but you often have to open and modify the new file created by hand after using these commands. I was very frustrated by this, because I was looking for a graphical user interface where I can just fill out the title, author, date, and other information about a page, then I can start writing the content right away. That is why I provided the RStudio addin "New Post" and the function `blogdown::new_post()`. In the past few years, I hated it every time I was about to create a new post either by hand or via the Jekyll command line. Finally I felt addicted to blogging again after I finished the RStudio addin.] This missing feature means that you cannot easily generate results using R code on your web pages, since you can only use static Markdown documents. Besides, you have to use Hugo's choice of the Markdown engine named "Blackfriday" instead of the more powerful Pandoc.^[There is a feature request in Hugo's repository that has been more than three years old: https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/234, and it seems that it will not be implemented in the near future.]

Hugo uses a special file and folder structure to create your website (Figure \@ref(fig:folders)). The rest of this chapter will give more details on the following files and folders:

- `config.toml`
- `content/`
- `static/`
- `themes/`
- `layouts/`

(ref:folders) Possible files and folders created when you create a new site using **blogdown**.

```{r folders, fig.cap='(ref:folders)', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/folder-structure.png')
```

## Configuration

The first file that you may want to look at is the configuration or `config` file, in which you can set global configurations of your site. It may contain options like the title and description of your site, as well as other global options like links to your social networks, the navigation menu, and the base URL for your website.

When generating your site, Hugo will search for a file called `config.toml` first. If it cannot find one, it will continue to search for `config.yaml`.^[Hugo also supports `config.json`, but **blogdown** does not support it, so we do not recommend you to use it.] Since most Hugo themes contain example sites that ship `config.toml` files, and the TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) format appears to be more popular in the Hugo community, we will mainly discuss `config.toml` here.

We recommend you to use the TOML syntax only for the config file (you can also use YAML if you prefer), and use YAML as the data format for the metadata of (R) Markdown pages and posts, because R Markdown and **blogdown** only fully support YAML.^[TOML has its advantages but I feel they are not significant in the context of Hugo websites. It is pain to have to know yet another language TOML, when YAML stands for "Yet Another Markup Language". I'm not sure if the XKCD comic applies in this case: https://xkcd.com/927/.] If you have a website that has already used TOML, you may use `blogdown::hugo_convert(unsafe = TRUE)` to convert TOML data to YAML, but please first make sure you have backed up the website because it will overwrite your Markdown files.

The Hugo documentation does not use TOML or YAML consistently in its examples, which can be confusing. Please pay close attention to the configuration format when copying examples to your own website.

### TOML Syntax

If you are not familiar with the TOML Syntax, we will give a brief overview and you may read the [full documentation](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) to know the details.

TOML is made up of key-value pairs separated by equal signs:

```js
key = value
```

When you want to edit a configuration in the TOML file, simply change the value. Values that are character strings should be in quotes, whereas boolean values should be lowercase and bare. 

For example, if you want to give your website the title "My Awesome Site", and use relative URLs instead of the default absolute URLs, you may have the following entries in your `config.toml` file.

```js
title = "My Awesome Site"

relativeURLs = true
```

Most of your website's global variables are entered in the `config.toml` file in exactly this manner. 

Further into your `config` file you may notice some values in brackets like this:

```js
[social]
    github  = "https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown"
    twitter = "https://twitter.com/rstudio"
```

This is a table in the TOML language and Hugo uses them to fill in information on other pages within your site. For instance, the above table will populate the `.Site.Social` variable in your site's templates (more information on this in Section \@ref(templates)).

Lastly, you may find some values in double brackets like this:

```js
[[menu.main]]
    name = "Blog"
    url = "/blog/"

[[menu.main]]
    name = "Categories"
    url = "/categories/"

[[menu.main]]
    name = "About"
    url = "/about/"
```

In TOML, double brackets are used to indicate an array of tables. Hugo interprets this information as a menu. If the code above was found in a `config.toml` file, the resulting website would have links to Blog, Categories, and About pages in the site's main menu. The location and styling of that menu is specified elsewhere, but the names of each menu's choices and the links to each section are defined here. 
 
The `config.toml` file varies between each theme. Make sure that when you choose a theme, you read its documentation thoroughly to get an understanding of what each of the configuration options does (more on themes in Section \@ref(themes)).

### Options

All built-in options that you may set for Hugo are listed on [this page](https://gohugo.io/overview/configuration/). You can change any of these options except `contentDir`, which is hardcoded to `content` in **blogdown**. Our general recommendation is that you'd better not modify the defaults unless you understand the consequences. We list a few options that may be of interest to you:

- `baseURL`: Normally you have to change the value of this option to the base URL of your website. Some Hugo themes may have set it to `http://replace-this-with-your-hugo-site.com/` or `http://www.example.com/` in their example sites, but please make sure to replace them with your own URL (see Chapter \@ref(deployment) and Appendix \@ref(domain-name) for more information on publishing websites and obtaining domain names). Note this option can be a URL with a subpath, if your website is to be published under a subpath of a domain name, e.g., `http://www.example.com/docs/`.

- `enableEmoji`: You may set it to `true` so that you can use [Emoji emoticons](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com) like `:smile:` in Markdown.

- `permalinks`: Rules to generate permanent links of your pages. By default, Hugo uses full filenames under `content/` to generate links, e.g., `content/about.md` will be rendered to `public/about/index.html`, and `content/post/2015-07-23-foo.md` will be rendered to `public/post/2015-07-23-foo/index.html`, so the actual links are `/about/` and `/post/2015-07-23-foo/` on the website. Although it is not required to set custom rules for permanent links, it is common to see links of the form `/YYYY/mm/dd/post-title/`. Hugo allows you use several pieces of information about a source file to generate a link, such as the date (year, month, and day), title, and filename, etc. The link can be independent of the actual filename. For example, you may ask Hugo to render pages under `content/post/` using the date and title for their links:

    ```js
    [permalinks]
        post = "/:year/:month/:day/:title/"
    ```
    
    Personally I recommend you to use the `:slug` variable instead of `:title`:
    
    ```js
    [permalinks]
        post = "/:year/:month/:day/:slug/"
    ```
    
    This is because your post title may change, and you probably do not want the link of the post to change, otherwise you have to redirect the old link to the new link, and there will other types of trouble like Disqus comments. The `:slug` variable falls back to `:title` if a field named `slug` is not set in the YAML metadata of the post. You can set a fixed slug so that the link to the post is always fixed and you will have the freedom to update the title of your post.
    
    You may find a list of all possible variables that you can use in the `permalinks` option on [this page](https://gohugo.io/extras/permalinks/). 

- `publishDir`: The directory under which you want to generate the website.

- `theme`: The directory name of the Hugo theme under `themes/`.

- `uglyURLs`: By default, Hugo generate "clean" URLs. This may be a little surprising and requires you to understand how URLs work when your browser fetches a page from a server. Basically Hugo generates `foo/index.html` for `foo.md` by default instead of `foo.html`, because the former allows you to visit the page via the clean URL `foo/` without `index.html`. Most web servers understand requests like `http://www.example.com/foo/` and will present `index.html` under `foo/` to you. If you prefer the strict mapping from `*.md` to `*.html`, you may enable "ugly" URLs by setting `uglyURLs` to `true`.

- `hasCJKLanguage`: If your website is primarily in CJK (Chinese, Korean, and Japanese), you are recommended to set this option to `true`, so that Hugo's automatic summary and word count work better.

Besides the built-in Hugo options, you can set other arbitrary options in `config.toml`. For example, it is very common to see an option named `params`, which is widely used in many Hugo themes. When you see a variable `.Site.Params.FOO` in a Hugo theme, it means an option `FOO` you set under `[params]` in `config.toml`, e.g., `.Site.Params.author` is `Frida Gomam` with the following config file:

```js
[params]
    author = "Frida Gomam"
    dateFormat = "2006/01/02"
```

The goal of all these options is to avoid hardcoding anything in Hugo themes, so that users can easily edit a single config file to apply the theme to their websites, instead of going through many HTML files and make changes one by one.

Option names are case-insensitive, so `.Site.Params.AUTHOR` is the same as `.Site.Params.author`.

## Content

The structure of the `content/` directory can be arbitrary. A common structure is that there are a few static pages under the root of `content/`, and a subdirectory `post/` containing blog posts:

```bash
_index.md
about.md
vitae.md
post/
  |
  |- 2017-01-01-foo.md
  |- 2017-01-02-bar.md
  |- ...
...
```

### YAML metadata

Each page should start with YAML metadata specifying information like the title, date, author, categories, tags, and so on. Depending on the specific Hugo theme and templates you use, some of these fields may be optional.

Among all YAML fields, we want bring tese to your attention:

- `draft`: You can mark a document as a draft by setting `draft: true` in its YAML metadata. Draft posts will not be rendered if the site is built via `blogdown::build_site()` or `blogdown::hugo_build()`, but will be rendered in the local preview mode (see Section \@ref(local-preview)).

- `publishdate`: You may specify a future date to publish a post. Similar to draft posts, future posts are only rendered in the local preview mode.

- `weight`: This field can take a numeric value to tell Hugo the order of pages when sorting them, e.g., when you generate a list of all pages under a directory, and if two posts have the same date, you may assign different weights to them to get your desired order in the list.

- `slug`: A character string as the tail of the URL. It is particularly useful when you define custom rules for permanent URLs (see Section \@ref(options)).

### Body

As we mentioned in Section \@ref(output-format), your post can be written in either R Markdown or plain Markdown. Please be cautious about the syntax differences between the two formats when you write the body of a post.

Besides all Markdown features, Hugo provided a useful feature named "shortcodes". You can use a shortcode in the body of your post. When Hugo renders the post, it can automatically generate an HTML snippet based on the parameters you pass to the shortcode. This is convenient because you do not have to type or embed a large amount of HTML code in your post. For example, Hugo has a built-in shortcode for embedding Twitter cards. Normally this is how you embed a Twitter card (Figure \@ref(fig:jtleek-tweet)) on a page:

```html
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anyone know of an R package for
    interfacing with Alexa Skills?
    <a href="https://twitter.com/thosjleeper">@thosjleeper</a>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/xieyihui">@xieyihui</a>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/drob">@drob</a>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/JennyBryan">@JennyBryan</a>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/HoloMarkeD">@HoloMarkeD</a> ?
  </p>

</blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">
</script>
```

```{r jtleek-tweet, fig.cap='A tweet by Jeff Leek.', fig.align='center', out.width='80%', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/jtleek-tweet.png')
```

If you use the shortcode, all you need in the Markdown source document is:

```go
{{< tweet 852205086956818432 >}}
```

Basically you only need to pass the ID of the tweet to a shortcode named `tweet`. Hugo will fetch the tweet automatically and render the HTML snippet for you. For more about shortcodes, see https://gohugo.io/extras/shortcodes/.
