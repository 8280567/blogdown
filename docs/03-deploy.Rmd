# Deployment

Since the website is basically a folder containing static files, it is much easier to deploy than websites that require dynamic server-side languages such as PHP or databases. All you need is to upload the files to a server, and usually your website will be up and running shortly. The key question is which web server you want to use If you do not have your own server, you may try the ones listed in this chapter. Most of them are free (except Amazon S3), or at least provide free plans. Disclaimer: the authors of this book are not affiliated with any of these services or companies, and there is no guarantee that these services will be provided forever.^[It is very likely to find other similar services if you use your search engine.] 

Considering the cost and friendliness to beginners, we currently recommend [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). It provides a free plan that actually has quite a lot of useful features. If you have no experience in publishing websites before, just log in using your GitHub account or other accounts, drag the `public/` folder built by **blogdown** for your website to the Netlify page, and your website will be online in a few seconds with a random subdomain name of the form `xxxx.netlify.com` provided by Netlify (you can customize it). You can easily automate this process, and see Section \@ref(netlify) for more details.

The second easiest solution may be [Updog](https://updog.co). It features the Dropbox integration. Publishing a website can be as easy as copying the files under the `public/` folder of your **blogdown** website to a Dropbox folder. The free plan of Updog only provides limited features, but its Pro plan only requires a one-time payment, and you will have access to much richer features.

If you do not mind using command-line tools or are familiar with GIT/GitHub, you can certainly consider services like GitHub pages, Travis CI, or Amazon S3 to build or host your websites. No matter which service you use, please keep in mind that none of them can really lock you and you are always free to change the service. As we have mentioned before, one great advantage of **blogdown** is that your website will be a folder of static files that you can move to any web server.

## Netlify

As we just mentioned, Netlify allows you to quickly publish a website by uploading the `public/` folder through its web interface, and you will be assigned a random subdomain `*.netlify.com`. This approach is good for those websites that are not updated frequently (or at all), but it is unlikely that you do not need to update your website, so we introduce a better approach in this section,^[Please bear in mind that this section is to outline the basic steps of publishing a website with Netlify, and the technical details may change from time to time, so the official Netlify documentation should be the most reliable source if you have any questions or anything we introduced here does not work.] which will take you a few more minutes to complete the configurations, but once it is properly configured, all you need to do in the future is to update the source repository, and Netlify will call Hugo to render your website automatically.

Basically you have to host all source files of your website in a GIT repository. You do not need to put the `public/` directory under version control^[You can add `public` to `.gitignore` to ignore it in GIT.] because it is to be automatically generated. Currently Netlify supports GIT repositories hosted on GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket. With any of these accounts, you can log in Netlify from the its homepage and follow the guide to create a new site from your GIT repository.

Netlify supports several static website generators, including Jekyll and Hugo. For a new site, you have to specify a command to build your website, as well as the path of the publish directory. Netlify also supports multiple versions of Hugo, so the build command can be the default `hugo` (see the Netlify documentation to know what the default version is), or a specific version of Hugo, e.g., `hugo_0.19`. The publish directory should be `public` unless you have changed it in your `config.toml`.

It may take a minute or two to deploy your website on Netlify for the first time, but it can be much faster later (a few seconds) when you update your website source, because Netlify deploys incremental changes in the `public/` directory, i.e., only the newer files compared  to the last time are deployed.

After your GIT repository is connected with Netlify, the last issue you may want to solve is the domain name, unless you are satisfied with the free Netlify subdomain. If you want to use a different domain, you need configure some DNS records of the domain to point it to the Netlify server. See \@ref(domain-name) for some background knowledge on domain names.

If you are not familiar with domain names or do not want to learn more about them, an option for your consideration is a free subdomain `*.rbind.io` offered by RStudio, Inc. Please visit the Rbind support website <https://support.rbind.io> to know how to apply for a subdomain. In fact, the Rbind organization also offers free help on how to set up a website based on **blogdown**, thanks to a lot of volunteers from the R and statistics community.

## Updog

The simplest solution: store the website in Dropbox, and point Updog to the folder. Done.

## GitHub pages

Prebuild the website to HTML, and publish the `public` folder to the `user.github.io` repo, `gh-pages` or the `docs` folder.

## Travis + GitHub

Build the website on Travis, and publish to GitHub automatically.

## Travis + Amazon S3
